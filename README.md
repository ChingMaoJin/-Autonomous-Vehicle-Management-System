# Description
This is an autonomous vehicle management system that utilize various data structures and algorithms. 
This system will efficiently manage a fleet of autonomous vehicles and support real-time queries about vehicle status and location.
I have implemented key data structures and algorithms such as graphs, hashing, heap and sorting algorithms (Heapsort, quicksort) without using java imported library

# Compilation
``` bash
javac *.java
```
- This compiles all the java file
# Execution
```bash
java DSAMain
```
- You may test the program with your own graph or follow my test case.
